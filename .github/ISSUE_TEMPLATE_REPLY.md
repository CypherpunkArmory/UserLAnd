It looks like you've posted an issue that requires more details for our team to be able to start
working on it.

We have created some issue templates to assist you in this process. These issue templates can be
found [here](https://github.com/CypherpunkArmory/UserLAnd/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).

To correctly follow the template, all of the headers from the template must be present in your
new issue. The headers for each template are the lines that begin with a '#'. Include the
headers, and then provide the data the headers require in the space below that header.

Following these templates will help our team begin work on your issue. We often cannot get started
at all without that information, which is why we created this bot to help us out.

Please be as descriptive as possible when posting your issue, including _any_ steps we would need
to recreate it. If reproducing your issue requires us to figure out how to reproduce it in the
first place, it will marked low priority.

If your issue is not updated to follow a template, we will likely close it within the week.

Thanks for using UserLAnd and for helping us improve it!
