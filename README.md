## This is FOSS
This app is released under the GPLv3.  The source code can be found here.
The icon, Wilber, the GIMP mascot, comes from a vector image source (SVG) made available by Jakub Steiner, available as Creative Commons by-sa 3.0.
This app is not created by the main GIMP development team.  Instead it is an adaptation that allows the Linux version to run on Android.
